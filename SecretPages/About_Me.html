    <h5><i>Freeze Frame</i> I bet you're wondering how I got here. </h5>
    <p>I first started coding in 5th grade, and have loved it ever since. I can code in Python, a bit of Java, and of course HTML, CSS, and JS (what this page is coded in)  <br>I first started playing games on Christmas 2018, when I got my first Nintendo Switch. This was a pivotal moment in my life, as it was the moment where I became even more interested in coding (and playing) games. My current favorite games include but are not limited to: The Forest, Elden Ring, and Minecraft. <br>My music taste is very eclectic, as I like many different genres and artists. Some examples include Sabaton, Weird Al Yankovic, and various Lofi artists.</p>
